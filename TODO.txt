Project: Workers
================

+Tasks
------
Pending:
1. Create scheduler that deletes files from Config.temp_folder that are older than X amount of time. To clean up stale certificates.
2. Load the admin website for resque-retry in Procfile
3. Evaluate @backoff_strategy in the BaseWorker. Update it so that it lasts at least several months of attempts in exponential backoff.
4. Break this into a GEM in the future. Also dont include libraries that arent really needed. Simplify transaction model in the future so that workers have a state machine a simple db representation they can interact with.
