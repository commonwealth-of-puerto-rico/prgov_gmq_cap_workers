Prior to having a working resque-retry, cronjobs can be used to
work around retrying jobs. The following is an example of crons
of how one might get jobs retried for a hypothetical user. 

Automatically request the GMQ page for forcing all jobs to be completed.
Process any misbehaving transactions that haven't been retried automatically.

Use crontab to configure them, ie:
crontab -u <username> <crontab file> 

Example:
crontab -u myuser gmq.retry
